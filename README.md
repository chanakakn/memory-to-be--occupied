# memory-to-be--occupied

The OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model is used to generate AI responses. You need to replace 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.

The generate_ai_response function sends a prompt to the GPT-3.5 model and retrieves a response. The generated response is printed to the console.

After memory occupation and release, the script enters a loop that allows the user to have a conversation with the AI. The user can input questions or messages, and the AI responds accordingly. To exit the conversation, the user can type 'quit'.

The AI's response is generated using the user's input as a prompt. The AI-generated response is then printed to the console.

This enhanced version adds an interactive conversation feature powered by the AI model, allowing users to have a more engaging experience with the script.
